Homepage
========

This is my personal website. I'm going to try and keep my projects hosted on
here - their blogs, support, deployment & git repositories, etc., but that
will come in time. For now, you can see my personal
[blog posts](/blog).

I'm currently seeking employment, so if you would like to reach out
to me and work together, please
[drop me a line](/contact). Or, if you would like to talk about projects / ideas,
feel free to ping me on
[#haskell](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/haskell) or
[via email](mailto://athan@deconfigured.com).

Woo!
