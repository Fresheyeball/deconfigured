## Books

#### Implementing Programming Languages

> by **_Aarne Ranta_** - [available here](http://www1.digitalgrammars.com/ipl-book/)

This book was incredible. It gives you a straight forward mapping of Haskell
based ADTs and language grammers. It also teaches you some theory on compilers,
like FSA and their variants, but very breifly. The gold comes from BNFC.

#### Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design

> by **_Richard Bird_** -
> [available on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Pearls-Functional-Algorithm-Design-Richard/dp/0521513383)

I have not gotten substantially through this book, because it is so dense with
incredibly valuable information. In the second chapter, Bird and some students
dissect methods to increase the performance of some functions; the exploration
is remarkable - seeing their tactics to optimizing are very unique.
